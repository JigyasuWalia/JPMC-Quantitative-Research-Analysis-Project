## JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience
### Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program offered through Forage. The program consisted of four main tasks that provided hands-on experience in quantitative research and financial modeling.
Tasks Completed
### 1. Investigate and Analyze Price Data
Developed a Python script to analyze and predict natural gas prices
Implemented a model combining linear and trigonometric components
Created functions to forecast prices for specific dates
### 2. Price a Commodity Storage Contract
Built a pricing model for natural gas storage contracts
Calculated injection and withdrawal costs, storage fees, and potential profits
Implemented logic to determine optimal injection and withdrawal strategies
### 3. Credit Risk Analysis
Analyzed a loan portfolio to estimate default probabilities
Implemented logistic regression and decision tree models
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC curves
### 4. Bucket FICO Scores
Developed an algorithm to convert continuous FICO scores into categorical buckets
Optimized the number of buckets and their boundaries using log-likelihood
Implemented dynamic programming techniques for efficient computation
### Skills Demonstrated
Data analysis and visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Financial modeling and commodity pricing
Machine learning for credit risk assessment
Optimization algorithms and dynamic programming
Git version control and GitHub project management
### Reflections
This virtual experience provided valuable insights into the work of quantitative researchers at JPMorgan Chase. It challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical financial problems and improved my skills in data analysis, modeling, and Python programming.
### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank JPMorgan Chase and Forage for providing this learning opportunity. The program offered a realistic glimpse into the work of quantitative researchers in the financial industry.
